<!-- We have finalized some additional requirements for the HTML/CSS Certification 
    for our course,
We would like Cohort 1 & 2 students to create an Email Template mockup in 
HTML/CSS using Bootstrap Grid.
Please create a template that is visually 
similar to the reference photo attatched below.

Please Use the Bootstrap Library and the Bootstrap Grid System.
            
Your project does not have to be a perfect recreation, but 
you should try to get it to closely resemble the picture.

Your template should have 3 column sections like the reference photo.
You will want to make sure to design the template so that the different 
sections of the page display differently and clearly when the viewport is resized.

You can easily acomplish this with Bootstrap Grid's column classes. (col-md, col-lg)  

Please refer to the bootstrap documentation, look at the examples they provide, 
and create your own files for experimenting with bootstrap grid if you are confused.  
Spending time writing code and experimenting with what works will help you learn 
and understand what is going on much better than trying to understand 
what to do on the first try. -->
